Repeated philosophy of the Model View Controller (MVC).
Goal 1: View, Controller and Model completely separated
Goal 2: all views completely separated.

Answered questions regarding the content:
- We won't use a framework.
- Progressive Web Application (PWA) are usually part of the module web programming, but can be picked up on week 10, if
requested
- PWA is also a web client
- CSS++ stands for advanced use of CSS
- For web client we will only look at the javascript
- We won't look at the differences between the various frameworks
- What is a dependency? If you are in charge of the code (not dependent of a latest version) then you are not dependent
Self-made framework is not a dependency
- We won't look at the dependency of the different browser versions
- We won't look at how we make a web application responsive --> WebEngineering
- We will do automated testing
- No need to fork the project. You can program along and just over write your changes with Mr. König's code by pulling
 from the master branch
- No actual difference between const Observable = v => {} and function Observable(v) {}
the first one is more stable
